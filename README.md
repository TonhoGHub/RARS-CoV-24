# Pac-Man Clone - RISC-V Assembly Project

## Overview
This project is a **clone/parody of Pac-Man** developed in **RISC-V Assembly** for the **Introduction to Computing Systems (ISC)** class. Although the game is not completely finished, it is still fully functional and provides a fun gameplay experience. 

## How to Run
You can play the game by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the **GAME** folder.
2. Run the file `RARSCOV24.s` using the included **FPGRARS.exe** emulator.

## Important Notes
- The **load screen** will disappear after the background music finishes playing. Please be patient as the game takes a moment to start.
  
## Project Status
- **Partially complete**: Some features may still be under development, but the game is in a playable state.
