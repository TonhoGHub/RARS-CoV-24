This is a clone/parody of "Pac-Man", developed in RISC-V Assembly for "Introduction to Computing Systems" class. 
It's not finished, but still fully functional.

You can run it by executing the "RARSCOV24.s" file with "FPGRARS.exe", included in the GAME folder.

P.S: the loadscreen will go away after the music stops playing. Please, be patient :)
